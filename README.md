#### 14.  NETHUNT
>Can pictures truly be deceptive? In a way, yes. They can often convey more information than words ever could. This is because pictures allow us to see things in ways that words cannot - they enable us to experience something vicariously. So if you're someone who likes to nitpick every detail, then we have a challenge for you! Not just any challenge though; this one twists your brain into knots! Are you ready? Here it goes...!!!
